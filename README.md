## ⚠️ Note

This project uses **Tailwind CSS via CDN**, not the installed version. Tailwind classes are written directly in the `index.html` file.

For production-level apps, Tailwind is usually installed via PostCSS and bundled using tools like Vite or Webpack.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Add working mobile nav menu toggle  
- Deploy with Tailwind installed via Node/PostCSS  
- Add animations or projects section with live previews
